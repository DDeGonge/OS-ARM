# OS-ARM
An open-sourced, low cost, high performance 3D printed 6-axis robotic arm. The main goals of this project are
- Smooth, repeatable motion
- ~1kg payload
- ~500mm range
- Low cost (<$500 in materials)
- Easy to reproduce (only requiring an FDM printer and basic hand tools)
- Beautiful
- Easy to control

This arm is not industrial and it will not be fast, but that is not my goal. But it will hopefully be a very nice looking arm fully capable of 6dof motion, cheap enough to keep it accessable but capable enough to actually do something (aka carry more than a 50g payload). This is not your typical RC servo arm. It's gonna be epic.

Developemnt will likely take until the end of 2021. If you are interested in contributing (either cad, software, pcb, or UI) let me know! I'm not immediately looking for collaborators, but once the design architecture is ready I will begin to open it up to other developers. Together, we can build something truly amazing!
