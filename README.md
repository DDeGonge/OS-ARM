# OS-ARM
An open-sourced, low cost, high performance 3D printed 6-axis robotic arm. The main goals of this project are
- Smooth, repeatable motion
- ~1kg payload
- ~500mm range
- Low cost (<$500 in materials)
- Easy to reproduce (only requiring an FDM printer and basic hand tools)
- Beautiful
- Easy to control

This arm is not industrial and it will not be fast, but that is not my goal. But it will hopefully be a very nice looking arm fully capable of 6dof motion, cheap enough to keep it accessable but capable enough to actually do something (aka carry more than a 50g payload). This is not your typical RC servo arm. It's gonna be epic.

Developemnt will likely take multiple years. This repo will be a work in progress until stated otherwise. Use these files at your own risk!
